### Social

The template allows to add all major social platforms to your site.
Fill the the form for each platform. If you leave the share_* entries empty, the sharing buttons below a post are not shown.  If you leave the **url** and **desc** empty the icons are not shown on the index page, but the share icons on the article pages remains untouched (Thanks to [Phil](https://github.com/philsturgeon))

* **icon**:	name of social platform (must match a name of [font-awsome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icon set )
* **url**:	url of your account
* **desc**: slogan of the platform
* **share_url**: share url
* **share_title**: first part of url for the title
* **share_link**: second part of the share url for the link to the post

The Liquid template engine will magical combine the different parts to a share url.
