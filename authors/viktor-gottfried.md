My name is Viktor Gottfried, a seasoned software developer and consultant based in the charming town of Soest. With over 15 years of professional experience, I've had the privilege of creating and implementing a variety of applications and microservice platforms across a multitude of companies.

These days, you'll find me in the helm of SWCode as a co-founder and CTO, where I put my passion for cloud-native applications into practice. It's not merely a workspace for me, but a haven where I employ my expertise to craft innovative tech solutions. You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktorgt/)

## Background

Over the years, my career in software development has seen me delve into various technologies and frameworks. A significant portion of that time, a full decade, was dedicated to Java, with a particular focus on Spring Boot. These days, I find myself more immersed in Kotlin and Ktor, discovering and utilizing the wide array of features these tools provide. However, my work extends beyond just coding. A facet of my role that I truly relish is consulting with our customers, not only on Identity Access Management but also on matters of software architecture. I hold a strong conviction that robust and secure access to digital resources is as crucial in today's interconnected world as is a well-designed software structure. Both are fundamental building blocks in creating reliable and efficient digital ecosystems.

Every day, I strive to push boundaries in the world of software development, constantly exploring, learning, and implementing. If you're as excited about the potential of software as I am, or if you need advice on software solutions or identity management, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always up for a chat.
