It's a cloudy monday morning. Your jeans are soaked from the rain on the way to the office. There's only a sip of cold coffee left in your mug as you are leaving your desk with your presentation notes.

Your heart is pounding, as you open the door to the meeting room, knowing that a dozen of people sit there, waiting.
Jeff, the coworker you teamed up with, nods and smiles, reassuring that everything is prepared. Everyone's staring at you.

"So, this is the fantastic game Jeff and I worked on", you say nervously.
"Jeff, could you please put it on the Screen?"

Jeff goes "Alright!" and plugs his Laptop in. Everyone sees the cat trying to eat cotton candy, his desktop background. 
"Jeff could you please open the Game?" What is he waiting for?

"No, I cannot open the Game", Jeff explains calmly, "the attachment in your mail last week was corrupted, so of course I don't have it. I didn't want to get in your way."

### WTjeFf?!

You take a deep breath. Isn't that wonderful. What a bold move, Jeff.

Think about it for a second: If your human colleague was doing what Unity does, you'd dig up their dead pet cat called Pumpkins, and leave the stiff body on their bed while they're sleeping. Well, at least I would.

Let's shift perspectives: What would you have done in Jeff's position?

## What could have been

# Why so series
This blog post is part of a series: Making Unity a decent employee. Well, at least a little less horrible, I admit.

These posts are largely independent. However, you should go read the [introduction here] if you haven't done that yet, and then come back. Otherwise, you might be thinking "wtf, why are we doing all of this again?" when reading the wonderfully ridiculous code sections later in this post.

> Disclaimer: I'm working in a rather unconventional project environment. For example, we embed a Unity View into an existing Android/iOS App. That's because we at [SWCode](https://swcode.io) build an app that uses AR, called [SoesTour](https://www.so-ist-soest.de/de/tourismus/sehenswertes/soestour.php). The app aims to revive historical sites that long vanished, by digitally showing them at their exact locations in the real world. Due to this complicated setup, I had to touch with some nasty Unity bits that most people might not have to touch. I want this article to be generally applicable, so don't worry about it. It might be fun either way!

Here's where we are at:

The Four Strategies
-------------------
<!-- TODO copy from introduction -->


# IV. Perform rigorous checks at build time (the banger! also black magic)

## Check code

## Check settings

## Check asset data


Problem: Script/Object/Prefab Missing
I just wish I had a robot that would take care of such repetitive tedium for me[.](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/12/01/lets-stop-copying-c/)
